          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>I am a software engineer at Moringa School. I completed my form four class last year at Kariobangi North Girls Secondary School and I completed my primary level at Asulma Center Primary School.I have never had a job before so no job experience.I decided to take a programming class because back in high I did an example of making a game using Alice3,that made me choose that class.Secondly, I want to make softwares that deal with certain computer crimes like <strong>fraud.</strong></p>
